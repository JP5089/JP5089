- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JP5089. 
I live in Australia have an electrical engineering/business background and am interested is using 30 odd years of Delphi experience.
I am particularly interested in how to do this while trading Crypto currencies and using blockchain technology. 
Started 6 months ago so very much in a learning and developing phase.
I am encouraged by how much code is actually shared on this site.
